		Let's Introduce you to PhoneGap<br><br>
        <b>PhoneGap :	</b>	
        <ul>
        <li>PhoneGap is a mobile development framework produced by Nitobi, purchased by Adobe Systems.</li>
        <li> It enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.</li>
        <li>The core of PhoneGap applications use HTML5 and CSS3 for their rendering, and JavaScript for their logic.</li>
        <li>PhoneGap is also able to be extended with native plug-ins that allow for developers to add functionality that can be called from JavaScript, allowing for direct communication between the native layer, and the HTML5 page. PhoneGap includes basic plugins, that allow access to, for example, the accelerometer.</li>
        <li>PhoneGap currently supports development for the operating systems Apple iOS, Google Android, LG webOS, Microsoft Windows Phone, Nokia Symbian OS,[27] RIM BlackBerry, and Tizen (SDK 2.x). Support for recent versions, such as BlackBerry 5 and 6 and Windows Phone 7, is being implemented now.</li>
